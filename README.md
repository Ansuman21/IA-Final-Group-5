# IA-Final-Group-5: Road Safety Insights (Montgomery)

### Objective:

• Identify common causes of traffic collisions.

• Determine high-risk locations and times for traffic accidents.

• Examine factors contributing to collisions, such as weather, traffic control, and driver/pedestrian behavior

### Goal:

• Use data analysis to support traffic safety measures.

• Inform policy decisions to reduce accidents and improve road safety.

• Highlight trends that may indicate potential risk factors or areas for improvement

### Insights:

• Collision Patterns: Most common types of collisions, e.g., rear-end, angle, or single-vehicle crashes.

• Risk Factors: Factors that increase the risk of collisions, including weather, traffic control, driver substance abuse, or distracted driving.
